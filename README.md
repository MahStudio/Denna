## Story

Denna's idea came from my own needs. I'm not punctual at all, so I needed a tool to make me care more about my time. So with the help of the whole team in MahStudio, we came across with a project named *Plannel* which then became **Denna**.

**Denna** is a name of a mountain in Iran.
The idea of creating Denna, poped up to my mind, when I couldn't spend enough time to study, and failed to answer some of the questions on my test. The answer of one those missed questions them was "Denna".

Then with the help of the team and the community, we developed and released a lovely tool named Denna. The main goal of Denna is to help people to care more about their time. Because time flies!

Ease of access and productivity, are Denna's core values.

You can see V 2.1 milestone [HERE](https://github.com/MahStudio/Denna/milestone/2)

### Build Prerequisites

1. Windows 10
2. Visual Studio 2017 (latest build) with universal windows development features installed.
3. GIT for Windows ([install from here](http://gitforwindows.org/))
4. Knowledge about C#, Xaml, [Realm](https://realm.io/), MVVM, design patterns and Windows development

### Build instructions

We use realm as our database and sync engine, so see [Realm.net documentation](https://realm.io/docs/dotnet/latest/) first.

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Denna Solution
3. Open [Realm cloud website](https://cloud.realm.io/) and register for a realm instance for free. If you don't want sync, skip this step and open an [issue](https://github.com/MahStudio/Denna/issues) and ask us for the solution.
4. Back into solution, there is a missing `Constants.cs` file. Replace it with following code. Remember that you should paste your *realm instance URL* in `ServerUri`.
5. Register for an app in Microsoft App Center and paste your *app secret code* in `AppCenterSecret`. If you don't want analytics you can skip this and write a random string there.

```csharp
using System;
namespace Core
{
    public static class Constants
    {
        public static readonly Uri ServerUri = new Uri("My realm server URL");
        public static readonly string AppCenterSecret = "Your App Center secret" ;
    }
}
```

6. Hit F5 and run the project
